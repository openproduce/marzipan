# Marzipan

Marzipan is an open source point-of-sale system for a small retailer.

* `register/` tree handles actual sales, including printing receipts.

* `web/customer/` holds customer-facing web tools that allow customers
  to look at their personal information (tab balances, for example).  

* `web/staff/` holds staff-facing web tools, which allow staff to
   access data and manage ordering through the web.

* `scripts/` holds non-web scripts that can be run against the
  marzipan databases.

This is a work in progress.  There are many baked-in customizations for the
launch customer, Open Produce.  Collaborators are welcome!
