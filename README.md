# Marzipan

Marzipan is an open source point-of-sale system for a small retailer.

* The staff/ tree holds all staff tools:
    * The staff/register/ tree handles actual sales, including printing receipts
      and running credit cards.
    * The staff/web/ tree allows staff to access data and manage ordering
      through the web.

* The customers/ tree has tools used by customers to look at their
  personal information (tab balances, for example).  Currently all of
  these are web tools.

This is a work in progress.  This repository has been created for the
purpose of cleaning up the code before moving it to a public
repository.  Current problems include private information saved in the
code and non-anonymized sample data.
