? frame border changes color with activity

Our requirements are:
+ is fast
+ runs within screen
+ doesn't crash
+ backs up its data nightly
+ progressive search for items by name
+ creates a record of each transaction including timestamp and total
+ allows the user to easily change item names, prices, or metadata
+ allows the user to easily add items
+ It is important to be able to add things quickly (in the middle of
  ringing someone up).
+ prices per pound or per piece
+ allow for 'other' item for when things don't work.

Our wishlist is:
- ability to inspect and modify recent transactions
- metadata about whether an item is produce, grocery, soda, non-consumable
+ Search by PLU, UPC, or name
- temporary price changes for sale items
+ indication how how sale was payed for (tab, cash, CC)
- keep track of tabs and who owes how much (with easy search, etc.)
- produce accounts payable report at end of each month saying how much we
  are owed and by whom (for our accountant)
- allows user to email a reminder-to-pay directly from the tab interface
- allows user to easily identify two items as duplicates (will remove one
  from list but keep it around for historical data).
+ email receipts to user upon request

Some Day:
+ print receipts (we can print cash receipts from our CC machine but would
  be nice to print itemized receipts, too -- currently we have to email or
  do by hand)
- interface with serial port on scale
- Have separate, customer-facing display with either just the total or a
  list of items with prices and total.
